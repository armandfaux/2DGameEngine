# Kaelinn Engine - v-1.0
Kaelinn Engine is a 2D engine for building games and simulations

## Prerequisites
The engine is fully self-contained which means you don't need to install the necessary libraries
Instead, you'll just have to install Conan, a packet manager that will install all the dependencies for you
See : https://docs.conan.io/2/installation.html
